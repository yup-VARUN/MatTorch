# CSC 4330 Project - Domain Specific Language - MatTorch

Ultimate goal was to create THE MOST ENGLISH LIKE language to write deep learning code and train them. One which executes blazingly fast on Apple's GPU using low level Metal Shading Language interface. 

However due to time limitations I have bits and pieces working as a proof of concept. With a lot of time and man power a full blown compiler could be made for this language!

It would be highly technical to pull off though. 
Hi Mom, I wrote my first GPU program! 
I've now learned Apple's Metal Shader Language and how to dispatch computations on the GPU in its unified memory architecture. This implementation is gown down to the FMA(Fused Multiple Add) units of the GPU cores!
